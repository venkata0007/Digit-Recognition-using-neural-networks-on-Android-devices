# Running neural networks on Android devices
This submission contains a Report, Demo Video, Code for the app (digit_recognition), a .ipynb file containing the models used and this README.md file.
## Running the .ipynb file
- We just need to run all the cells to see the outputs (Although outputs are already being displayed in the file as they were already run before)
- `Note:` We have used number = 1.jpg, number = 2.jpg, number = 9.jpg, number = 10.jpg image files as hand written inputs, you can add the images to the directory and run if needed.
## Running the App
- To run the app you need the latest version of flutter and Android Studio / VS Code to be installed on your system.
- Once you have them, unzip the digit_recognition folder and open it in either Android Studio or VS Code. 
- Then, to install all the dependecies used in the project, you can use the following command after changing the directory to the project directory (digit_recognition)
    ``` flutter pub get ```
- Then, to run the app use the following command after selecting a device or an emulator
    ``` flutter run ```
